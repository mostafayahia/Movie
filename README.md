# Movie
you have to replace MyMovieDbApiKey in the file app/build.gradle with your api key (to get yours, you can create account and get one https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)

This app displays popular movies or top rated movies or users' favorite movies according to the user preference

My app designed with the following assumptions:
1 - Maximum # of trailers for each movie that the user can watch is two.\n
2 - The app doesn't display any info about the popular or top rated movies in case of the device doesn't have an internet connection, but the user is still able to see any favorite movie (because it is stored in local database in his device).
